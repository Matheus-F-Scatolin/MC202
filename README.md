# MC202: Data Structures Programming Labs Collection üßë‚Äçüíª

This repository contains a collection of C programming lab exercises. These were completed as part of a university course, focusing on fundamental programming concepts and data structures.

## üìú Description

This repository serves as a personal archive of solutions to various programming challenges. The exercises primarily focus on implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms using the C programming language ‚öôÔ∏è. Each lab tackles a specific problem or concept, providing practical application of theoretical knowledge.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple directories, where each directory named `lab-XX-Matheus-F-Scatolin-main` represents a distinct lab assignment or project.

For example:
*   `lab-01-Matheus-F-Scatolin-main/`: Contains the first lab.
*   `lab-02-Matheus-F-Scatolin-main/`: Contains the second lab.
*   ...and so on.

Each lab directory typically contains the C source code files (`.c`), header files (`.h` if any), and sometimes a `makefile` for easy compilation.

## üß† Topics/Concepts Covered

This collection covers a range of fundamental computer science topics, including but not limited to:

*   **Basic C Programming:** Syntax, control flow, functions, pointers.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Arrays
    *   Linked Lists
    *   Stacks (`pilha.c`)
    *   Queues (potentially `fila_prioridades.c` for priority queues)
    *   Trees (`arvore.c`)
    *   Hash Tables (`hash_table.c`)
    *   Graphs (`grafo.c`)
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   Expression evaluation (e.g., using stacks and trees in `expressoes.c`)
    *   Sorting and searching (common in such lab series)
    *   Graph traversal
    *   Memory management
*   **Problem Solving:** Applying these concepts to solve specific challenges presented in each lab.

This repository can be a valuable resource for understanding the practical implementation of these concepts in C.

## ü§î How to Use

Each lab directory (`lab-XX-Matheus-F-Scatolin-main/`) is structured as a standalone C project. To explore a specific lab:

1.  Navigate into the lab's directory.
2.  Review the C source code files (`.c`, `.h`).
3.  If a `makefile` is present, you can typically compile the project by running the `make` command in the terminal from within that directory.
4.  Execute the compiled program as per the lab's specific instructions (if available) or by running the resulting executable.

This repository can be used for:
*   Learning C programming through practical examples.
*   Understanding implementations of common data structures and algorithms.
*   Reference for similar academic exercises.
